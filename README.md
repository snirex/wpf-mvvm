Solution for MDClone interview test - Create wpf mvvm solution for handling tabcontrol with different tabs content:
---
Ahead of the interview at md c***, for a WPF key job, we wanted to send you an exercise exercise During the interview we will have a conversation about the exercise path.

Exercise:
1. Build an app in any way you choose
2. The main screen will consist of a title, 2 buttons and a tab display (for example Chrome browser tabs):
     1. Add table data button
     2. Button for adding an email submission form

3. Each time one of the buttons is pressed, a tab is added according to the button pressed.
4. It will be possible to load information from a file into a data table (to select the key)
5. Click on Send Email and a message will appear stating that the email has been sent.

* Note that you can add the same type of tab multiple times without limitation.
* It is not necessary to actually send an email after filling in the details on the form - bonus
* It is not necessary to invest in the design, but only in the file structure - a bonus.

It will probably be a large and complex project and therefore the project must be built with this in mind.
